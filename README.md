# Reinforcement Learning Algorithms

I am currently learning the basics of Reinforcement Learning and try to implement many of the popular algorithms using PyTorch.


# Implementations

* [REINFORCE](https://github.com/johanngerberding/reinforcement-learning-pytorch/tree/master/reinforce)
* [Deep Q-Networks](https://github.com/johanngerberding/reinforcement-learning-pytorch/tree/master/dqn) (including extensions)
* [A2C](https://github.com/johanngerberding/reinforcement-learning-pytorch/tree/master/actor_critic)
