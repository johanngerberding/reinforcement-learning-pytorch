# Actor-Critic

Here will my Actor-Critic implementation live. `a2c` contains a monte carlo version of actor critic which can solve the CartPole environment for now (some code for saving models and stuff is still missing). I am working on atari as well and I will create a bootstrapped version and a version with shared parameters.
