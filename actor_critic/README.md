# Actor-Critic

Here will my Actor-Critic (A3C) implementation live. `a3c` contains a monte carlo version of actor critic which can solve the CartPole environment for now (some code for saving models and stuff is still missing, see below). I am working on atari as well and I will create a bootstrapped version and a version with shared parameters.

#Todos

## A3C

* implement n-step returns 
* asynchronous version / multiple environments
* generalized advantage estimation (GAE)
* test on atari environments
